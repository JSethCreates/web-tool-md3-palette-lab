# MD3 Palette Tool

A one-page tool for generating and fine-tuning color palettes in Google's Material Design 3 (MD3) system.

---

## üé® Purpose

This tool allows you to explore and compare how MD3 color logic behaves when generated **manually using HCT rules** versus **automatically via Google's Material Color Utilities (MCU)**.

## üîç Color Generation Logic

### Primary
Generated using the seed hue with **high chroma (e.g. 48)** and a **mid-dark tone (e.g. 40)**. This produces a vivid, deep version of the base color.

### Secondary
Uses the **same hue** but with **lower chroma (e.g. 16)** at the **same tone (40)**, yielding a more muted companion.

### Tertiary
Shifts the hue by **+60¬∞** (moving one ‚Äúsegment‚Äù on the color wheel), with **moderate chroma (e.g. 24)** at **tone 40**. This provides a harmonizing accent.

### Neutral & Neutral-Variant
Generated using low-chroma HCT colors at tone 40:
- **Neutral**: chroma ‚âà 4
- **Neutral-variant**: chroma ‚âà 8
- Includes a very dark neutral for "on-surface" tokens

These serve as grayish supporting tones.

## üß† Google's Material Color Utilities (MCU)

Google's MCU uses your source ARGB color to generate a full **101-tone HCT palette** for that hue (tones 0‚Äì100). This tonal palette:
- Maintains **consistent hue**
- Dynamically adjusts **chroma per tone**
- Ensures **contrast/legibility**

### Example Tone Assignments in MD3 (Light Scheme):
- `primary` = tone 40 from accent
- `onPrimary` = tone 100
- `primaryContainer` = tone 90
- `onPrimaryContainer` = tone 10
- `secondary` = tone 40 from secondary accent
- `tertiary` = tone 40 from a tertiary accent
- `surface` = tone 99
- `onSurface` = tone 10

Google provides a system-wide mapping table assigning tones to every `md-sys-color-*` role, sometimes with adjusted hues (e.g., for neutral-variant tones).

## ‚úÖ Contrast Assurance

The MCU algorithm adjusts chroma dynamically to ensure each tone passes WCAG contrast ratios, creating **accessible, balanced palettes** by design.
